   # Broker Configuration
   ALPACA_API_KEY=your_alpaca_key
   ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_alpaca_secret
   ALPACA_ENDPOINT=https://paper-api.alpaca.markets

   # ML Configuration
   MODEL_REGISTRY_PATH=/path/to/model/registry
   ```

3. **Run the Setup Script**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup_env.sh
   ```

   This script will:
   - Check system requirements
   - Create and activate a Python virtual environment
   - Install Python dependencies
   - Set up configuration files
   - Start database containers
   - Create database schema
   - Install frontend dependencies

4. **Start the Development Environment**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/start_dev.sh
   ```

   This will start all services for local development.

5. **Access the Platform**

   - Web Dashboard: http://localhost:3000
   - API Gateway: http://localhost:8080
   - Swagger Documentation: http://localhost:8080/api-docs

### Production Installation

For production deployment, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Kubernetes Cluster**

   Set up a Kubernetes cluster using your preferred cloud provider (AWS EKS, Google GKE, or Azure AKS).

2. **Configure Kubernetes Context**

   ```bash
   kubectl config use-context your-cluster-context
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `config/.env.prod` file with your production environment variables.

4. **Deploy the Platform**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy.sh --env prod
   ```

   This script will:
   - Build Docker images
   - Push Docker images to registry
