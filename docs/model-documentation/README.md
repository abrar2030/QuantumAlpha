### Risk Models

Risk models are used to measure, analyze, and manage various types of financial risks. These models help in understanding the potential losses that may occur due to market movements, credit events, liquidity constraints, or operational failures.

#### Market Risk Models

Market risk models estimate the potential losses due to changes in market prices or rates.

##### Value at Risk (VaR) Models

VaR models estimate the maximum potential loss over a specified time horizon at a given confidence level.

1. **Historical Simulation VaR**

   **Description**: Estimates VaR by revaluing the current portfolio using historical market data changes.
   
   **Methodology**:
   - Collects historical returns for all risk factors affecting the portfolio

   **Assumptions**:
   - Historical patterns will repeat in the future
   - Sufficient historical data is available to capture extreme events
