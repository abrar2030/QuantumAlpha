# QuantumAlpha Test Suite

This directory contains the comprehensive test suite for the QuantumAlpha trading platform.

## Overview

The test suite is organized into the following categories:

- **Unit Tests**: Tests for individual components and functions
- **Integration Tests**: Tests for interactions between components
- **System Tests**: End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- **Utilities**: Helper functions, fixtures, and mock objects for testing

### Running Tests with Coverage

```bash
pytest --cov=backend tests/
```

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation. They verify that each function or method works correctly on its own.

Key unit test modules:

- `ai_engine`: Tests for AI models and prediction services
- `common`: Tests for shared utilities and models
- `data_service`: Tests for data processing and storage
- `execution_service`: Tests for order management and execution
- `risk_service`: Tests for risk calculations and management
- `web_frontend`: Tests for web frontend components
- `mobile_frontend`: Tests for mobile frontend components

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different components work correctly together. They focus on the interactions between modules.

Key integration test modules:

- `data_to_model`: Tests for data service to AI engine integration
- `model_to_risk`: Tests for AI engine to risk service integration
- `execution_to_risk`: Tests for execution service to risk service integration

### System Tests

System tests verify end-to-end workflows and ensure that the entire system works correctly as a whole.

Key system test modules:

- `test_auth_workflow.py`: Tests for user authentication and authorization workflows
- `test_data_pipeline_workflow.py`: Tests for data ingestion, processing, and storage workflows
- `test_end_to_end_trading_workflow.py`: Tests for complete trading workflows

## Test Utilities

### Fixtures

The test suite includes various fixtures to set up test environments and provide test data:

- `conftest.py`: Shared pytest fixtures
- `utils/fixtures/`: Additional fixtures for specific test scenarios

### Mock Objects

Mock objects are used to simulate external dependencies and isolate the code being tested:

- `utils/mocks/mock_objects.py`: General mock objects
- `utils/mocks/api_mocks.py`: Mock API responses

### Data Generators

Data generators create synthetic data for testing:

- `utils/generators/market_data_generator.py`: Generates synthetic market data

### Configuration

Test configuration utilities manage test settings:

- `utils/config/test_config.py`: Test configuration management

## Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state from other tests.
2. **Mocking**: Use mock objects to isolate the code being tested from external dependencies.
3. **Fixtures**: Use fixtures to set up test environments and provide test data.
4. **Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical components.
5. **Naming**: Use descriptive names for test functions that indicate what is being tested.
6. **Assertions**: Use specific assertions that provide clear error messages.
7. **Documentation**: Document test functions with docstrings explaining what is being tested.

## Contributing

When adding new tests:

1. Follow the existing directory structure and naming conventions.
2. Add appropriate fixtures and mock objects as needed.
3. Document test functions with docstrings.
4. Ensure tests are independent and do not rely on the state from other tests.
5. Run the full test suite to ensure your changes do not break existing tests.
