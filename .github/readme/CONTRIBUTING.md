   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QuantumAlpha.git
   cd QuantumAlpha
   ```

2. **Set Up Development Environment**

   ```bash
   # Create and activate a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   
   # Set up pre-commit hooks
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. **Set Up Frontend Development**

   ```bash
   # Web Frontend
   cd web-frontend
   npm install
   
   # Mobile Frontend
   cd ../mobile-frontend
   npm install
   ```

```

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We follow a Git Flow-inspired branching strategy:

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: New features or enhancements
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*`: Urgent fixes for production
- `release/*`: Release preparation

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types include:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `build`: Build system changes
- `ci`: CI configuration changes
- `chore`: Other changes

Examples:
```
feat(ai-engine): add support for transformer models
fix(data-service): resolve connection timeout with external APIs
docs: update installation instructions
```

### Pull Requests

1. Create a new branch from `develop` for your changes
2. Make your changes and commit them with descriptive messages
3. Push your branch to your fork
4. Open a pull request against the `develop` branch
5. Fill out the pull request template
6. Wait for code review and address any feedback

### Code Reviews

All submissions require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.

- Be respectful and constructive in reviews
- Focus on code quality, not style preferences
- Explain the reasoning behind your suggestions
- Approve once all issues are addressed

## Coding Standards

### Python

- Use [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for import sorting
- Use [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting
- Use [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking
- Write docstrings in [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings)

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Follow [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Write JSDoc comments for functions and classes

### Documentation

- Write clear, concise documentation
- Use Markdown for documentation files
- Document all public APIs
- Include examples where appropriate
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

## Testing

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Run the test suite before submitting a pull request

```bash
# Run backend tests
pytest

# Run frontend tests
cd web-frontend
npm test
```
